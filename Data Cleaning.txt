Data Cleaning

Three states of data exist:
-Beyond Repair
-Badly Damaged
-In the Wrong Form

Examples of data that is beyond repair:
-corrupted data
-data that is totally absent from files
-data that was overwritten
What to do: 
	delete it and move on

Examples of badly damaged data:
-garbled data
-many missing values
-inconsisten sources
-existing in multiple columns
What to do:
	Fill missing data:
	-substitute data from another source
	-interpolate between existing data points
	-extrapolating from existing data
	Standardize units of measure
	Consolidate data from multiple sources

Examples of data in the wrong form:
-too granular/too much detail
-numeric data stored as strings
-data that needs to be split into multiple columns, such as addresses
What to do:
	Reshape the data
	Change the data's organization
	Convert data types
	Parse text data
	Split columns

Data cleaning requires judgement! 
A general strategy is to use iterative processes to ensure that all of the data is formatted the same way.
